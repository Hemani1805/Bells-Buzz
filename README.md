# eth mood?


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Bells & Buzz


### Team Members

### Project Description
MoodReverser is a deliberately useless website that pretends to care about your emotions-then ruins them.
It fakes a mood test, forces you to pick how you really feel, and responds with sarcastic, mood-worsening comments.
Finally, it offers a completely absurd "mood potion" with steps guaranteed to fix nothing.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world flooded with positivity, mood boosters, and self-care apps, no one is intentionally making your day worse - and honestly, that's the real tragedy.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Destroying your mood with perfectly targeted sarcasm
You come in thinking you'll be heard - we fake a mood quiz and then laugh in your face.
You tell us you're happy? We crush that joy.
Feeling anxious? We give you more reasons to panic.
And if you're sad? Well, buckle up. It gets darker.
And ending with a "personal mood potion" that's completely useless (and proud of it).
